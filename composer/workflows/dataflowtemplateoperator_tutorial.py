"""Example Airflow DAG that creates a Cloud Dataflow workflow which takes a
text file and adds the rows to a BigQuery table.

This DAG relies on four Airflow variables
https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/variables.html
* project_id - Google Cloud Project ID to use for the Cloud Dataflow cluster.
* gce_zone - Google Compute Engine zone where Cloud Dataflow cluster should be
  created.
For more info on zones where Dataflow is available see:
https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/resources/locations
* bucket_path - Google Cloud Storage bucket where you've stored the User Defined
Function (.js), the input file (.txt), and the JSON schema (.json).
